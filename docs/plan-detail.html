## **Project 1: Automotive Company - AI for Parts & Fitment Standardization**

### **Business Problems**
1. Not every part manufacturer follows the same naming standards for the parts they manufacture.
2. Not every part manufacturer maintains a list of all the vehicles their parts fit under.

### **AI Solution**
Currently, companies rely on traditional ETL processes with predefined business rules and assumptions. AI can:
1. Use existing AI models (not from scratch) to categorize and standardize part names.
2. Train a model using publicly available automotive data to predict missing fitment information.

### **Implementation Plan**
1. **Data Sources**:
- Kaggle automotive datasets.
- NHTSA vehicle data API.
- Open-source auto parts data.
2. **AI Models**:
- Google Cloud Vertex AI AutoML for text classification and entity recognition.
- Amazon Comprehend for extracting part names and categories.
- Snowflake Cortex AI for vector search to find similar part names.
3. **Prototype Development**:
- Extract and process manufacturer part names.
- Apply Snowflake Cortex AI to detect duplicates/similar names.
- Use GCP AutoML or AWS Comprehend to predict missing vehicle fitment data.
4. **Deployment**:
- AI-powered ETL workflow to standardize part names.
- AI-driven recommendation engine for missing fitment data.

## **Project 2: Food Supply Chain Company - AI for Customer & Delivery Unification**

### **Business Problems**
1. **Duplicate Customer Records Across ERPs**
- A grocery store that buys meats and fresh produce appears as two different customers in different ERPs.
2. **Multiple Deliveries for the Same Customer**
- Separate deliveries due to different ERP feeds.

### **AI Solution**
1. AI can match and unify customers across multiple ERPs.
2. AI can consolidate deliveries to reduce inefficiencies.

### **Implementation Plan**
1. **Data Sources**:
- USDA Food Dataset.
- Kaggle grocery & retail data.
- SAP Data APIs for ERP connectivity.
2. **AI Models**:
- Google Vertex AI Matching Engine for deduplicating customers across ERPs.
- Amazon SageMaker Clustering for grouping similar deliveries.
- Snowflake Cortex AI for finding best customer matches.
3. **Prototype Development**:
- Extract customer records from different ERPs.
- Use AI-powered entity resolution for unified customer IDs.
- Apply AI clustering to optimize delivery schedules.
4. **Deployment**:
- Embed AI-powered customer matching into ETL workflows.
- Optimize delivery schedules dynamically using AI recommendations.
- Allow manual review for AI-generated matches.
