# My Generative AI Learning Journey

## Background
I operate at both strategic and hands-on levels:
1. Designing high-level architectures and coding.
2. Working with multi-cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, Snowflake, Redshift).
3. Focusing on data ecosystems, BI, data movement, and governance rather than core AI/ML model development.

## Objectives
I want to:
1. Leverage Generative AI to enhance data ecosystems, governance, and business intelligence.
2. Align AI applications with enterprise-scale data architectures (e.g., GCP Gemini, Snowflake Cortex, AWS AI).

### AI Learning Steps
1. AI Fundamentals (Governance, Ethics, Terminology)
2. GenAI Basics (LLMs, AI risks, and Responsible AI)
3. Prompt Engineering (Optimizing AI interactions)
4. Business & Enterprise AI Use Cases
5. Hands-on AI Projects
6. Vendor-Specific AI Implementations
